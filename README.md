# mailu
mailing app for you

We are four Dartmouth students from the class of 2022 working as Women in Science Program (WISP) interns in conjunction with the DALI Lab for the 2018-2019 school year.

mailU is a mobile application designed to allow students to connect students who want to request and deliver mailed packages from their college/university mailing serivce. We hope that users of this app from the Dartmouth community are able to easily request and deliver mailed items from Hinman in a seamless and easy manner.

 ## Architecture

 * [Expo](https://expo.io/) is a tool for React Native applications that, by providing a prototype formate, aided our development process.
* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) is the programming language we used to design and develop the structure of our iOS and Android application.
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) is a Google platform/infrastructure that provides us with a database to implement the backend of our app.

 ## Setup

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/dali-lab/shopu`
2. Enter the app's folder
3. Run `npm install` to install all node packages
4. Run `react-native link` to link all the assets in the project

 ## Deployment
1. In terminal tab, run `exp start` to run the server
2. In another terminal tab, run `exp ios` to run the iOS simulator
